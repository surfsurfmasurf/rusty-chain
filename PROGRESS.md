# Progress log

## Day 1
- Repo bootstrap
- Rust project scaffolding
- CI + docs baseline

Next:
- Define core data structures: `BlockHeader`, `Block`, `Chain`
- Add hashing + serialization

## Day 2
- Added core types: BlockHeader/Block/Transaction
- Added hashing helper (sha256 hex)
- Added Chain storage: genesis + JSON load/save
- CLI: init/status now write/read chain.json
- Tests: genesis + save/load roundtrip

## Day 3
- Genesis now uses real timestamp (ms)
- Added `validate` command (genesis invariants + prev_hash linkage)
- Added minimal PoW + `mine` command (leading '0' hex chars)
- Tests: validation + mining PoW checks

## Day 4
- Store PoW difficulty in `chain.json` (`Chain.pow_difficulty`) with serde defaults for backward compatibility
- `mine` persists the chosen difficulty, `status` prints it
- `validate` now enforces PoW for all non-genesis blocks
- Tests: PoW failure detection + JSON defaulting when the field is missing

Day 5
- Added mempool (file-backed) with tx add/list CLI
- Mining now includes mempool txs when present
- Merkle root now hashes tx hashes (order-sensitive)
- Added tests for merkle root + tx hash stability

Next:
- Add basic tx validation (nonce/amount sanity)
- Persist mempool alongside chain in demo workflow
- Improve tx display in status
